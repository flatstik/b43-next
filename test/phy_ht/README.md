# test/phy_ht — the HT-PHY against wl's bus

Compiles `phy_ht.c`, `tables_phy_ht.c`, `radio_2059.c` and `phy_common.c`
as they are, against the kernel headers (as `../integration` does), puts a
BCM4331 on a bus that turns their MMIO and agent accesses into the ops
`mmio2ops.py` prints, serves every read from the capture and compares the
two streams op by op.

```sh
make K=... KG=...        # the kernel headers, see ../integration/README.md
./check.sh               # every init of the R6400 v1 captures
./ht-trace FLOW OPS FIRST LAST [-v]
```

`check.sh` takes `$TRACES/bcm4331-rev2/r6400v1`: the board values from its
`nvram.txt`, the windows from its `traces/mmio-*`. A window runs from the
first table 0x1a read of `b43_phy_ht_tx_power_fix()` that is followed by the
control turned off, to the write that turns it on: the tail of
`b43_phy_ht_op_init()`, flow `pctl_init`. The cold captures have one in `up`
and one in `ssid`, the hot ones only on their first channel.

A flow passes only if both streams are equal, no read goes past the capture
and none of the capture's is left over, and b43 printed nothing.

All 14 windows pass.

## Exceptions

Compared by class and address only (`value_free[]` in `trace.c`):

- `TXPCTL_TARG_PWR` and `TXPCTL_TARG_PWR2`: b43 sets the target from
  `maxp2ga*` (0x60); wl writes 0x20 in the first init and its own target
  later (0x5a at 20 MHz, 0x56 at 40), from a computation not yet known.

## Flows

`pctl_init`, and its pieces for the windows of `cold-2g6-20` `up`:
`power_fix` (#5238–5270), `pctl_off` (#5271–5273), `idle_tssi`
(#5274–5497), `tssi_setup` (#5727–5735), `pctl_on` (#5736–5737).
